The term "robotics" was first coined in 1920, as a result of a a work of fictional play. However, proto-robots have existed since ancient times. From Atlas, the iron giant of Greek mythology, to the earliest robots designed for labor, these machines were created to replace physical tasks.

In modern times, humans have not only adopted technology to alleviate physical labor but also to enhance and meet our intricate social needs. This has led to a surge in the development of so-called social robots.

In traditional motion planning, neither feedback nor dynamics is considered. A solution path is considered open loop, which means there is no feedback of information during execution to close the loop.

How a robot should maintain appropriate interpersonal distance, follow or approach a person?

## Research questions:

### Socially dimension
- What is the need for a socially appropriate navigation? (fundamentals, AI)
- How has socially appropriate navigation been used in human-robot interaction?
- What cultural aspects are taken into account?
- What ethical aspects are taken into account?

### Experimental dimension
- How do we design scenarios to experiment? (independent vs. dependent variables)
- How do we model socially appropriate navigation? (input, output, IA approach, model)
- How do we evaluate socially appropriate navigation? (quantitative vs qualitative metrics, statistics)

### Practical dimension
- What are the primary application areas of socially appropriate navigation? (case studies and vs real-World applications)
- What are the primary research topics within each application area? (trends)

Most studies lack a theoretical foundation and have methodological weaknesses, including low statistical power or questionable research practices, leading to a high false-positive rate or overestimated effect sizes. Solutions such as pre-registration, higher sample sizes, transparency and a more careful theoretical underpinning based on models of human spacing behavior are discussed.

The most problematic area of evaluations in the context of human-aware navigation is the evaluation of comfort improve- ments due to changes in navigational decision making. The literature shows two main strategies in doing so, using a simulation based on a model ofwhat causes human-discomfort, or presenting participants with a robot and asking them to rate robot qualities via a questionnaire.

The great difference between the simulation environment and the real-world one is the major challenge to transfer the trained model to a real robot.
